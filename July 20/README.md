Describe the rules you used to create this project and briefly how you programmed this to happen:



Describe any difficulties you had and how you overcame them:

One of the issues I had was with output latency for sound and this seems to be an issue resulting from Windows 10. The Error is the following:

[DATE/TIME] com.jsyn.devices.javasound.JavaSoundAudioDevice <init>
INFO: JSyn: default output latency set to 80 msec for Windows 10

While I still could not find a proper fix for this, what I did do was use an external application to cut the audio file to start exactly when the sound plays. This fix does not solve the latency but does minimize it.



Mention anything interesting you discovered while doing this assignment:
