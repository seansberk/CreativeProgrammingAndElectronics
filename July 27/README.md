**Description of project**

This project aimed at making an integrated metronome that would play constantly with adjustable speeds with an auto plucker that could be used on a guitar. The idea was that it woulbe able to pluck multiple different string based instruments including a tisue box with rubberbands wrapped around it. The plucker would be used with a push of a button.

**Anything clever or tricky**

I had used an incrementing value of 1.6 times the metronome speed to increase and .625 to decrease the metronome rate. This provided the cleanest decimal point values. I also spent a decent amount of time making the functions which I think worked out to implement my project quite well.

**Problems (if any) and how you overcame them**
I have been having problems largely with compiling the program because for some reason some varaibles don't want to be declared.
