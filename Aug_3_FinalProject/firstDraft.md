**Title**

Mapping my Life

**Proposed Idea**

The idea I have in mind, is to create a robot that interacts with its environment and creates art based on inputs from the sensors onboard. Using the information from the sensors, I plan to make modifications to the way the art may be displayed or represented in graphical form. The idea is that there can be multiple different end art products which are the result of having the robot run around different rooms throughout the day. This will create a map of my life so to speak.

**Inspiration**

I took inspiration from a youtube video I watched of a cleaning robot that vaccuums and cleans floors and it was quite advanced. This led me to thinking about how I had held a conversation with someone about these cleaning robots and how they mapped the inside of your home, similar to how google maps the streets of the world. I thought this was an interesting concept and while I was doing research for our presentation, I had come across the creative programmer that I became inspired by who takes inputs from the world to create generative art. Their name is Patrick Hubner and they have produced unique alcohol labels based on weather patterns as well as dynamic art works responsive to twitter interactions. Taking the idea of multiple unique and diverse interactions from online, and devloping an artwork out of that became something that I thought could be applied to my life in at home especially while in quarantine where a lot of life has been centered around home based living.

**Planned Implementation**

While the robot will be mobile, it will be difficult to properly implement what I want and I am still thinking of how to do this. I had hoped to run it off a raspberry pi but I left mine in Berkeley and so am looking for an alternative to this.

I plan to use the temperature sensors as I live in a tropical country but use the AC often and so seeing how the temperature fluctuates would be interesting. 

I plan to use the ultrasonic sensor to prevent crashes while also gauging the size of the room be finding how far it can go before coming into a crash. This will help indicate what my home space is like and whether I spend most my time in smaller spaces or gravitate to more spacious areas.

I plan to use the light sensor to capture the type of lighting I tend to be around and utilize this information to impact the brightness of the artwork.
